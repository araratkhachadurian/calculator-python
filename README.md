In this project I aim to create a calculatorwith model-view-controller structure in Python.

8-2-2021 Changes:

Implemented basic calculator that can perform addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (* or x), division (/ or :) and powers (^) between two numbers.

Next goal:

Instead of 3 seperate input for first number, operator and second number, allow for a full mathematical string input (eg, 5 + 10 / 2, (5^2+10)x10).
